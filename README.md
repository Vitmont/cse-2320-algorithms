# CSE-2320 - Algorithms and Data Structures

Design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on data structures. Approaches to analyzing lower bounds on problems and upper bounds on algorithms. Classical algorithm design techniques including algorithms for sorting, searching, and other operations on data structures such as hash tables, trees, graphs, strings, and advanced data structureâ€¦
